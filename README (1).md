# DRY Refactoring of Farmer.py

## Summary of Changes

Original file: 529 lines
DRY version: 459 lines
Lines reduced: 70 lines (13.2% reduction)

## List of Improvements

1. **Decorators for Common Operations**:
   - Created `preserve_state` decorator to handle saving and restoring turtle position/heading
   - Created `function_visualizer` decorator to manage stack visualization

2. **Helper Functions for Repetitive Drawing**:
   - Added `draw_rectangle()` to handle the common rectangle drawing pattern
   - Added `add_label()` to standardize text labeling

3. **Generic Planting Function**:
   - Created a generic `plant_row()` function that accepts the plant type as a parameter
   - Reduced the repetitive code in the three plant_*_row functions

4. **Simplified Drawing Functions**:
   - Used loops where multiple similar items were drawn (windows, tomatoes)
   - Used data structures to store and iterate over similar patterns (carrot leaves)

5. **Improved Code Organization**:
   - Related functionality is grouped together
   - Helper functions appear before the functions that use them

## Preserved Functionality

All visual elements are identical to the original:
- Same colors and dimensions
- Same animations and timing
- Same stack visualization
- Same labels and text

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Maintainability**: Changes to common patterns can be made in one place
2. **Readability**: Functions are shorter and more focused
3. **Extensibility**: Adding new types of plants or farm elements is easier
4. **Code Reuse**: Common drawing patterns can be reused across the program
